To get the Lotj_MSP plugin working, you need to download the Lotj_MSP.xml plugin file and the sounds.zip file. The sounds.zip file needs to be extracted into your "%directory%\Mushclient\sound" file. Install the plugin through file > plugins > install. In the game type SOUND ON and CONFIG +SOUND.
Once the plugin is installed, use the soundhelp command for further information. I've included the MSP_LOTJ mushclient world in case others want to add custom triggers to the plugin, but it isn't necessary to get it working.
